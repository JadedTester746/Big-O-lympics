    <h1> Our Purpose: </h1>
    <h3> As members of the UIL Computer Science team, we want to create a tool to help us practice. Using our knowledge of networking, we will make a website to make testing seamless, and allow us to compare our results as a team. </h2>
    <h1> What is Big-(O)lympics </h1>
    <h3>
        Our website will be a UIl Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) practice site. Users will sign in/create an account and complete tests. On their profile page users will be able to view results of previous tests and see statistics related to their performance. Teachers will be able to manage a class of students and view individual and group statistics. There will also be a mode called written mania where students can answer unlimited questions for practice.
